| This file is dedicated for defining HTTP routes. A single file is enough
| for majority of projects, however you can define routes in different
| files and just make sure to import them inside this file. For example
|
| Define routes in following two files
| ├── start/routes/cart.ts
| ├── start/routes/customer.ts
|
| and then import them inside `start/routes.ts` as follows
|
| import './routes/cart'
| import './routes/customer'
|

import Route from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Route';

Route.get('/user/:id', async ({ params }) => {
  return params.id;
});
Route.post('/user', async () => {
  return '';
});
