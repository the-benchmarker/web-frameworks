<h1 class="title">Congratulations, your <a class="alert-link" href="http://luminusweb.net">Luminus</a> site is ready!</h1>

This page will help guide you through the first steps of building your site.

<p class="title is-5">Why are you seeing this page?</p>

The `home-routes` handler in the `luminus.routes.home` namespace
defines the route that invokes the `home-page` function whenever an HTTP
request is made to the `/` URI using the `GET` method.

```
(defroutes home-routes
  (GET "/" [] (home-page))
  (GET "/about" [] (about-page)))
```

The `home-page` function will in turn call the `luminus.layout/render` function
to render the HTML content:

```
(defn home-page []
  (layout/render
    "home.html" {:docs (-> "docs/docs.md" io/resource slurp)}))
```

The `render` function will render the `home.html` template found in the `resources/templates`
folder using a parameter map containing the `:docs` key. This key points to the
contents of the `resources/docs/docs.md` file containing these instructions.

The HTML templates are written using [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) templating engine.

```
<div class="content">
  {{docs|markdown}}
</div>
```

<p class="title is-5">Organizing the routes</p>

The routes are aggregated and wrapped with middleware in the `luminus.handler` namespace:

```
(defstate app
  :start
  (middleware/wrap-base
    (routes
      (-> #'home-routes
          (wrap-routes middleware/wrap-csrf)
          (wrap-routes middleware/wrap-formats))
      (route/not-found
        (:body
          (error-page {:status 404
                       :title "page not found"}))))))
```

The `app` definition groups all the routes in the application into a single handler.
A default route group is added to handle the `404` case.

The `home-routes` are wrapped with two middleware functions. The first enables CSRF protection.
The second takes care of serializing and deserializing various encoding formats, such as JSON.

<p class="title is-5">Managing your middleware</p>

Request middleware functions are located under the `luminus.middleware` namespace.

This namespace is reserved for any custom middleware for the application. Some default middleware is
already defined here. The middleware is assembled in the `wrap-base` function.

Middleware used for development is placed in the `luminus.dev-middleware` namespace found in
the `env/dev/clj/` source path.
