**Current target frameworks(middlewares)**
 - Ruby
   - [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
   - [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra)
   - [Roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda)
 - Crystal
   - [Kemal](https://github.com/kemalcr/kemal)
   - [router.cr](https://github.com/tbrand/router.cr)
 - Go
   - [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)
   - [gorilla-mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
 - Rust
   - [IRON](https://github.com/iron/iron)
   - [nickel.rs](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs)
 - node
   - [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
 - Elixir
   - [Plug](http://github.com/elixir-lang/plug)

## The rule
I want to know the response time, not a usability. So full-stack framework is at a disadvantage.
 - Each server has no special logics.
 - Each server's executable is named as `server_[Lauguage]_[Framework]`. (For example, `server_ruby_sinatra`)
 - There are only 3 routes
   - GET  '/'         return status code 200 with empty body
   - GET  '/user/:id' return status code 200 with the id
   - POST '/user'     return status code 200 with empty body

## Installation

Required environment -> See **Current target frameworks(middlewares)**

### By using Neph

[Neph](https://github.com/tbrand/neph) is a modern command line job processor.  

To compile servers and benchmarker,
```
> neph
```
For each language,
```
> neph -j ruby
```
For each framework,
```
> neph -j rails
```

See [neph.yml](https://github.com/tbrand/which_is_the_fastest/blob/master/neph.yml)

### By using make

To compile servers and benchmarker,
```
> make
```
For each language,
```
> make ruby
```
For each framework,
```
> make rails
```

## Usage

You can take a benchmark by
```bash
> bin/benchmarker
```

If you take it manually, you can run each server by
```bash
> bin/server_[Language]_[Framework]
```

and run client by
```bash
> time bin/client
```

You can set # of threads and # of request loops(there are 3 requests in a loop) by
```bash
> time bin/client -t 16 -r 1000
```
In the above example, 16 threads requests 1000 * 3 times.
So 48000 requests are sent in total.

## Development
 - **Give me PR when you want to add other web frameworks**
 - **Give me PR when you can tuning each framework (under the rule)**
