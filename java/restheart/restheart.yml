## RESTHeart Configuration File.

#### Listeners

# Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
# The supported protocols are: http and https.
# You can setup a listener per protocol (up to 2).

# WARNING: Using the http listener is not secure with basic authentication:
# credentials can be sniffed by a man-in-the-middle attack.

https-listener: false
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 4443

http-listener: true
http-host: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 3000

ajp-listener: false
ajp-host: 0.0.0.0
ajp-port: 8009

#### Instance name

# The name of this instance.
# Displayed in log, also allows to implement instance specific custom code

instance-name: restheart-benchmarker

#### Performance Options

# Number of I/O threads created for non-blocking tasks. at least 2. suggested value: core*2
io-threads:
  1
  # Number of threads created for blocking tasks (such as ones involving db access). suggested value: core*16
worker-threads: 4

# Limit for the maximum number of concurrent requests being served
requests-limit: 200000

### Security

## SSL Configuration

# Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

# RESTHeart Securitycomes with a self-signed certificate that makes
# straightforward enabling https.
# Specify use-embedded-keystore: true to use it (this is the default setting).
# Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients;
# for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.

use-embedded-keystore: true

## Allow unescaped characters in URL

# Starting with Undertow 1.4.23 URLs validation became much stricter.
# However, this is breaking existing clients. Now you can decide which behaviour you prefer

allow-unescaped-characters-in-url: true

#### Plugins configuration

# The directory containing the plugins jars.
# The path is either absolute (starts with /) or relative to the restheart.jar file
# Just add the plugins jar to plugins-directory and they will be automatically
# added to the classpath and registered.

plugins-directory: null

plugins-args:
  ping:
    enabled: false

#### Logging

# enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
# enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
# log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart.log in system temporary directory)
# log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)
# ansi-console: use Ansi console for logging. Default to 'true' if parameter missing, for backward compatibility
# requests-log-level: log the request-response. 0 => no log, 1 => light log, 2 => detailed dump           DATABASE => at db level, COLLECTION => at collection level
# WARNING: use requests-log-level level 2 only for development purposes, it logs user credentials (Authorization and Auth-Token headers)

enable-log-file: false
log-file-path: /usr/local/var/log/restheart.log
enable-log-console: false
log-level: "OFF"
requests-log-level: 0
ansi-console: true

#### Performance Options

# In order to save bandwitdth RESTHeart Security can force requests to support the giz encoding (if not, requests will be rejected)
force-gzip-encoding:
  false
  # Use 16k buffers for best performance - as in linux 16k is generally the default amount of data that can be sent in a single write() call
buffer-size: 16384
buffers-per-region:
  20
  # Should the buffer pool use direct buffers, this instructs the JVM to use native (if possible) I/O operations on the buffers
direct-buffers: true

#### Connetction Options

connection-options:
  # The maximum size of a HTTP header block, in bytes.
  # If a client sends more data that this as part of the request header then the connection will be closed.
  # Defaults to 1Mbyte.
  MAX_HEADER_SIZE: 1048576

  # The default maximum size of a request entity.
  # Defaults to unlimited.
  MAX_ENTITY_SIZE: -1

  #The default maximum size of the HTTP entity body when using the mutiltipart parser.
  # Generall this will be larger than MAX_ENTITY_SIZE
  # If this is not specified it will be the same as MAX_ENTITY_SIZE
  MULTIPART_MAX_ENTITY_SIZE: -1

  # The idle timeout in milliseconds after which the channel will be closed.
  # If the underlying channel already has a read or write timeout set
  # the smaller of the two values will be used for read/write timeouts.
  # Defaults to unlimited (-1).
  IDLE_TIMEOUT: -1

  # The maximum allowed time of reading HTTP request in milliseconds.
  # -1 or missing value disables this functionality.
  REQUEST_PARSE_TIMEOUT: -1

  # The amount of time the connection can be idle with no current requests
  # before it is closed;
  # Defaults to unlimited (-1).
  NO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: -1

  # The maximum number of query parameters that are permitted in a request.
  # If a client sends more than this number the connection will be closed.
  # This limit is necessary to protect against hash based denial of service attacks.
  # Defaults to 1000.
  MAX_PARAMETERS: 1000

  # The maximum number of headers that are permitted in a request.
  # If a client sends more than this number the connection will be closed.
  # This limit is necessary to protect against hash based denial of service attacks.
  # Defaults to 200.
  MAX_HEADERS: 200

  # The maximum number of cookies that are permitted in a request.
  # If a client sends more than this number the connection will be closed.
  # This limit is necessary to protect against hash based denial of service attacks.
  # Defaults to 200.
  MAX_COOKIES: 200

  # The charset to use to decode the URL and query parameters.
  # Defaults to UTF-8.
  URL_CHARSET: UTF-8

  # If this is true then a Connection: keep-alive header will be added to responses,
  # even when it is not strictly required by the specification.
  # Defaults to true
  ALWAYS_SET_KEEP_ALIVE: true

  # If this is true then a Date header will be added to all responses.
  # The HTTP spec says this header should be added to all responses,
  # unless the server does not have an accurate clock.
  # Defaults to true
  ALWAYS_SET_DATE: false
